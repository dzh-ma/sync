# 1. Introduction

This report contains content regarding to the second stage of the *Sync Smart Home* project.
This report will comprehensively review the following:
- System design
- System development
- System evaluation

The project is aimed to deliver a fully-functional smart home managing application with the following features:
- Real-time energy monitoring
- Device automation
- Data analysis for energy consumption

Throughout Stage 2, we focused on finalizing the design & usability (UI/UX) of the system,
    addressing feedback received from Stage 1, whilst ensuring that any & all requirements specified were met.

This report covers:
- High-level system architecture
- Marketing strategy
- Usability testing results
- Overall project evaluation

# 2. Marketing Strategy & Materials

The *Sync Smart Home* system targets individuals in home environments,
    that are looking to reduce household costs by adopting more energy-conscious habits.
The primary audience of this system includes homeowners, families & regulars,
    aiming to lower utility bills & improve energy efficiency.

The **USP (Unique Selling Point)** of this system is in providing tailored recommendations
    in order to maximize energy savings, translating user actions directly into cost savings.

Planned marketing material includes:
- **Logo**
- **Website**

# 3. Final Application Design & Implementation

## 3.1 High-Level Overview

The *Sync Smart Home* application is built with modularity, scalability & flexibility in mind.
The key technologies used in this project includes:
1. **React** for the front-end
2. **FastAPI (Python)** for the back-end
3. **MongoDB** for the database

The application provides real-time energy monitoring, device control & automation.
This will be all accessible through a web-based interface (a *web-application*).

## 3.2 Final System Design

The system architecture follows a modular design, ensuring each component is independent & easily scalable.
The front-end communicates with the FastAPI back-end, which manages data storage & retrieval through MongoDB.

The system supports the following features:
- User registration & authentication
- Device management
- Real-time data monitoring
- Energy consumption analysis & reporting
- Device scheduling & automation

## 3.3 Interface Design & Navigation

The front-end interface was designed using Figma.
The interface's priority is on simplicity & user-friendliness.
The design process focused on reducing front-end elements visible at any given time to streamline navigation.

## 3.4 Implementation Methodology

The project followed an Agile methodology, with sprint-organized development.
The team used ClickUp's service to track progress & manage tasks for front-end & back-end teams.
Regular sprint reviews along with line manager meetings, ensured continuous progress & adaptation.

## 3.5 System Testing

Extensive testing was conducted to ensure system functionality, security & stability:
- **Unit Testing:** Verified individual back-end components using tools like `pytest`
- **Integration Testing:** Ensured that different system components worked together seamlessly
- **Security Testing:** Focused on setting up JWT tokens to ensure secure role-based access control;
                    Pentesting was conducted to identify & resolve security vulnerabilities.

## 3.6 Installation & User Guide

# 5. Project Evaluation

## 5.1 Organization & Collaboration

The team collaborated effectively by working independently on front-end & back-end components,
    before merging progress.

A signification challenge in the project was in communication between front-end & back-end teams.
This caused delays early in the project, but was resolved through regular group meetings & improved deliberate coordination.

## 5.2 Implementation & Schedule

Despite initial delays, the project was brought back on track through careful sprint planning & consistent reviews.
The ClickUp tool would prove to be useful in maintaining agendas & ensuring that key milestones were met.

## 5.3 Product Overview

The final product meets the core requirements outlined in Stage 1.

It offers:
- Real-time energy monitoring
- Device automation & scheduling
- Comprehensive energy consumption analytics

The application is robust, user-friendly & ready for deployment.
