# Database Integration Tasks

1. **Update Database Initialization**
    > Ensures proper storage & efficient querying of new data models
    - [X] Modify `init_db()` in `database.py` to create indexes for new collections
    - [X] Add collection variables for devices, profiles, rooms, schedules, and energy summaries

2. **Create API Routes**
    > Establishes HTTP endpoints that users will interact with to manage devices, profiles, rooms & schedules
    - [X] Implement device routes (`device_routes.py`)
    - [X] Implement profile routes (`profile_routes.py`) 
    - [X] Implement room routes (`room_routes.py`)
    - [X] Implement schedule routes (`schedule_routes.py`)
    - [X] Extend energy data routes to support summaries

3. **Update Main Application**
    > Connects new routs to the FastAPI application (for user accessibility)
    - [X] Register all new routers in `main.py`
    - [X] Set appropriate URL prefixes and dependencies

4. **Implement Authentication for New Routes**
    > Adds security by ensuring only authorized users can access specific functionality
    - [X] Apply role-based access control to device management
    - [X] Set profile-specific permissions for data access

5. **Create Data Operations**
    > Implements business logic for manipulating data
    >> For handling complex scenarios that form the core functionality that makes the system useful
    - [ ] Add CRUD operations for devices, profiles, rooms, and schedules
    - [ ] Implement energy summary aggregation functions

6. **Update Frontend Integration**
    > Creates the user interface components that users will interact with
    - [ ] Create API service functions for new endpoints
    - [ ] Implement UI components for device management
    - [ ] Add profile management screens
    - [ ] Create schedule configuration interface

7. **Implement Testing**
    > Ensures new functionality works correctly & continues to work as changes are made
    - [ ] Add test fixtures for new data models
    - [ ] Write unit tests for new routes and functions
    - [ ] Create integration tests for the complete workflow

8. **Documentation Updates**
    > Provides guidance for developers & users on how to use new features
    - [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints
    - [ ] Document data models and relationships
    - [ ] Create usage examples for new features

9. **Database Seeding**
    > Creates realistic test data to populate system for developing & testing
    - [ ] Add sample data for devices, profiles, rooms, and schedules
    - [ ] Create seed scripts in the `seeds` directory

10. **Report Generation Enhancement**
    > Improves energy reporting with contextual information for new models
    - [ ] Update report generation to include device and room context
    - [ ] Add profile-specific reports
    - [ ] Include scheduled usage in energy summaries
